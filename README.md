Welcome to my GitHub profile\! I'm a passionate software engineer dedicated to building secure, scalable, and functional solutions, primarily within the insurance sector. I thrive on complex challenges, continuous learning, and leveraging technology to innovate and digitalize services.

## üöÄ About Me

  * üéØ **Mission-Driven Engineer:** I focus on delivering robust software where **security** is paramount (think 80% vigilance, 20% feature iteration ‚Äì a healthy paranoia for protection\!).
  * üí° **Problem Solver & Innovator:** I love diving into **complex problems**, embracing **new challenges**, and experimenting with cutting-edge **tools and technologies**.
  * üõ°Ô∏è **Insurance Domain Specialist:** My professional journey has been deeply rooted in the **insurance industry**, with all my projects contributing to significant digital transformations in this sector in Algeria.
  * ü§ñ **Automation & AI Enthusiast:** I'm a strong advocate for **automation** to streamline workflows and am actively exploring the realms of **data science** and **AI**.

## üèÜ Key Projects & Contributions

I've had the privilege of architecting and developing several high-impact platforms:

  * **e-Recours Algeria:** [e-Recours](https://e-recours.buaa.dz)
      * Led the development of the **national platform for managing automotive insurance claims in Algeria.**
      * This system handles **millions of requests monthly**, manages **terabytes of data and files**, processes **millions of records** per month, and supports over **15,000 active users** with concurrency reaching up to **10,000 users**.
  * **e-Attestation Algeria (Alpha release):** [e-Attestation](https://dev-attestation.nxtechs.com)
      * Played a key role in building Algeria's new **digital insurance certificate (e-attestation) system.**
      * The platform is engineered for high throughput, designed to handle over **200k transactions per hour** with maximum security as a core principle.
  * **e-Constat Algeria:** [e-Constat](https://demo-buaa.nxtechs.com)
      * Created the **"e-Constat" application**, an online tool for streamlined vehicle accident reporting in Algeria.
      * It enables parties involved in an accident (one or two vehicles) to digitally complete an accident report, attach photos of damages, and instantly transmit it to their own email addresses and their respective insurance providers.
  * **Multi-Lingual Web Platforms:**
      * Developed few **multi-language websites for various clients using Next.js**, incorporating modern web features and **headless CMS capabilities** for dynamic content management.

## üß† Current Focus

  * **High Impact Projects:** I'm currently working on a few high-impact projects that are changing the "visage" of the insurance sector in Algeria.
  * **Data Science Thesis:** Currently immersed in research and development for my thesis, exploring advanced techniques and tools in data science.
  * **LLM Exploration:** Experimenting with and testing various Large Language Models locally to understand their capabilities and potential applications.
